This is a full-stack web application that allows healthcare professionals to have a centralized place to quickly and easily assess important patient information.

Link to project: Coming soon

---

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ejs, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Cloudinary.

This site is my attempt to solve several problems that I have experienced and have heard about in my field. Healthcare professionals often have issues with centralization of patient information, navigation of patient charts, web apps not being mobile friendly and poorly designed.

This project includes password authentication. Users can see their caseload as well as all of the patients in the facility. Users can create and discharge patient charts.
